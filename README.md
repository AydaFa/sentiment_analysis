## Introduction
This project implements a Sentiment Analysis system using TensorFlow and a custom dataset. It allows you to train a machine learning model to classify text data into different sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, or neutral. The model can be used to analyze the sentiment of text data and make predictions.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python version: 3.6+
- TensorFlow version: 2.13.0
- Numpy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib for visualizing training history

## Setup
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required dependencies installed in your environment.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook `handwritten_text_analysis.ipynb` in a compatible environment (e.g., Google Colab).

## Training and Usage
The project includes the following key components:

- Data Preparation: You can use your own dataset for sentiment analysis. Ensure the data is properly formatted and labeled.
  
- Model Architecture: The Sentiment Analysis model typically consists of an embedding layer, recurrent layers (LSTM or GRU), and a dense output layer for sentiment classification.
  
- Model Training: Train the model using your labeled dataset. The model is optimized for text classification tasks using categorical cross-entropy loss.

- Visualizing Training: Visualize the model's training history, including accuracy and loss, using Matplotlib.

- Sentiment Analysis: Use the trained model to perform sentiment analysis on text data. The model will provide predictions for the sentiment category of the input text.

Feel free to customize the model architecture and hyperparameters to suit your specific dataset and requirements.

## Acknowledgments
This project is based on TensorFlow and makes use of custom text data for sentiment analysis.
